## 🚀 Key Projects & Products

### [PCNportal](https://pcnportal.dccn.nl/) | Lead Software Engineer
**A web-based platform for Normative Modelling in clinical neuroimaging.**
* **The Product:** Developed the full-stack architecture for [PCNportal](https://pcnportal.dccn.nl/), a GUI-driven platform that allows researchers to apply pre-trained normative models to individual brain data without writing code.
* **Engineering:** Implemented a distributed backend using **Docker** and **Flask**, capable of handling parallelized computation jobs on remote servers.
* **Impact:** Published in [*Wellcome Open Research*](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-326), the portal facilitates large-scale neuropsychiatric research by making high-level predictive models accessible to the clinical community.
* **Tech:** Python, Flask, Docker, Shell (HPC/Torque), JavaScript.

### [Visual Perception Lab: Postdiction](https://github.com/VisualPerceptionLab/Postdiction) | Lead Scientist
**Code for analysis of ultra-high resolution brain activity data used for Scientific Publishing.**
    As lead Scientist and creator of this lab-owned project, I created a codebase for collecting real-time brain data (7T fMRI / MEG) collection during an audiovisual human experiment with millisecond precision. To analyze this data, I developed a pipeline for ultra high dimensional time series data to decode illusory perception from brain activity - resulting into a peer-reviewd publication on how the brain creates conscious perception (Barkema et al., 2025).
* **Tech:** MATLAB, Bash, PsychToolBox, SPM.

### [CCI Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/PBarkema/Donders-IV-code-portfolio) | Inventor & Lead Dev
**Novel statistical framework for quantifying information from noisy brain responses.**
* **The Innovation:** Invented the **Cross-Condition Information (CCI)** metric to solve the problem of "nuisance noise" in MEG/fMRI data.
* **The Math:** Uses **Manifold Learning** and **Subspace Alignment** to prove that trial-by-trial neural variability is structured and functionally relevant to object recognition.
* **Scalability:** Optimized for High-Performance Computing (HPC) to process multi-terabyte datasets.
* **Tech:** Python (NumPy, SciPy), PCA, Bash.

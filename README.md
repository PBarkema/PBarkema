## 🚀 Key Projects & Products

### [PCNportal](https://pcnportal.dccn.nl/) | Lead Software Engineer
**A scalable platform for Machine Learning & Transfer Learning for Brain-Mapping at large scale.**

* **The Ecosystem:** Architected the portal to act as a **collaborative model repository**, allowing researchers worldwide to host and share their own pre-trained models. This design enables global scalability and standardized model deployment.
* **Large-Scale Bayesian Inference:** Engineered the backend to handle models trained on **10,000+ brain scans** across heterogeneous data collection sites, and facilitate **Transfer Learning** on user data. 
* **Engineering:** Implemented a distributed backend using **Docker** and **Flask**, capable of handling parallelized computation jobs on remote servers.
* **Impact:** Published in [*Wellcome Open Research*](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-326).
* **Tech:** Python, Flask, Docker, Shell (HPC/Torque), JavaScript.

### [Visual Perception Lab: Postdiction](https://github.com/VisualPerceptionLab/Postdiction) | Lead Scientist
**Code for analysis of ultra-high resolution brain activity data used for Scientific Publishing.**
* As lead Scientist and creator of this lab-owned project, I created a codebase for collecting real-time brain data (7T fMRI / MEG) collection during an audiovisual experiment with millisecond precision to induce audiovisual hallucinations in humans.
* I developed a pipeline to analyze this ultra high dimensional time series data and decode illusions from brain activity - resulting into a peer-reviewed publication (Barkema et al., 2025).
* **Impact:** [*Talk at top conference VSS*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UetvGUnviXQ).
* **Tech:** MATLAB, Bash, PsychToolBox, SPM.

### [CCI Analysis Pipeline](https://github.com/PBarkema/Donders-IV-code-portfolio) | Inventor & Lead Dev
**Novel statistical framework for quantifying information from noisy brain responses.**
* **The Innovation:** Invented the **Cross-Condition Information (CCI)** metric to solve the problem of "nuisance noise" in MEG/fMRI data.
* **The Math:** Uses **Manifold Learning** and **Subspace Alignment** to prove that trial-by-trial neural variability is structured and functionally relevant to object recognition.
* **Scalability:** Optimized for High-Performance Computing (HPC) to process multi-terabyte datasets.
* **Tech:** Python (NumPy, SciPy), PCA, Bash.
